				<span class="title">Our History</span>
				<br>
				<p>
					In 1970 Wayman and Nelda Mitchell moved to Prescott to take over a small, struggling congregation. Shortly after arriving, God saved a number of young hippies who were very different than anyone in the church. But as they were welcomed, God began to pour out His Spirit on the congregation.  As Pastor Mitchell sought to reach young people, they saw the possibilities of the “coffee-house” concert ministry. At the first concert they ever tried as an evangelistic tool, more than 200 young people attended, with many saved. Out of this a regular concert ministry was birthed. 2 nights a week, bands played, testimonies of salvation were given and the Gospel was preached, with many being saved each night.
		 		</p>
		 		<br>
		 		<p>
					From the beginning, Pastor Mitchell understood that  concert ministry was to be a training ground of ministry development; It was run by young people who were committed to Jesus and His church.  From the beginning, people who had been radically converted sought to share with others what God had done in them. Personal evangelism began to be one of the basic foundations of the church.  Then came impact teams: Groups of people that would travel to other nearby cities to help people there experience what God was doing here. Over time, God began to reveal His plan of discipleship: Training young couples for ministry within a local church.  In 1973 the first couple was launched directly into the ministry – and God blessed them!  Churches then began to be planted throughout the Southwestern United States, and then further across America as converts prayed for the Gospel to be preached in their hometowns.
				</p>
				<br>
		 		<p>			 
					In 1978 the first couple was planted into another nation – Australia; and we discovered the Gospel worked there, just like it did here.  After that, churches were planted in Mexico, Holland and Germany then as we came to understand God’s global mission more and more, churches began to be planted throughout the world. To date, there are over 2100 churches in 44 US states, and 117 nations of the world.

					In October, the church capitalised on Halloween by creating a House of Horrors. 16 victims at a time were transported on a motorized platform through 7 scenes. “The Devil” led them through his house of hellish horrors demonstrating his handiwork. Complete with stunning SFX that were sure to scare the Heck out of you. Held over three nights, we saw 350+ visitors and 110-recorded salvations.
				</p>
				<br>
		 		<p>			 
					Over our summer, the disciples set up concerts and movies in the parks. This has been a fruitful time of discipleship, raising up men and seeing souls saved! Disciples saw responses of up to 50 souls in one event! In the month of January alone, the collective effort of the church saw 200 souls saved. God is incredible.

					In March, Pastor Mitchell demonstrated the power of Jesus Christ at our annual Miracle Healing crusade. Many nationalities were represented. There were at least 52 decisions for Christ, and 17 demonstrated miracles. 
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>			 
					Our annual Easter march continues to draw crowds in our city centre. Roman centurions crucify Jesus. With slight of hand a resurrected Jesus is then presented, followed by testimonies and an altar call. Hundreds of people heard the gospel and souls were saved.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>			 
					Ps Mitchell then preached our Miracle Increase conference. In the last year the church has sent out four couples, two of which were international including a church into China.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>			 
					In April, the church held an Anzac Day dawn service. The event honoured soldiers who shed their blood for our freedom and Jesus Christ who shed His blood for our salvation. An estimated 750 people attended, with 500 visitors. Preceding the dawn service, a traditional breakfast was held with a gospel presentation. A powerful testimony by an Army Captain from our fellowship resulted in 6 souls saved.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>			 
					The church received a shot in the arm of the Holy Ghost as Ev. Kris Hart preached revival. God moved powerfully with 18 demonstrated miracles. One disciple had a short leg grow out and then was given a word that he would be involved in the supernatural. Ev. Kris Hart then asked that disciple to pray for a new convert who’s leg also then grew out! Many Visitors, 13 filled with the Holy Ghost and 8 people saved!
